# Challenge-1-Code-Refactor
## The goal of this project was to update the html and css of a fictional marketing company's website to make it better for accessibility. This goal was met by adding semantic HTML elements to code, adding alt tags to images, consolidating the css and HTML code, and giving the HTML and css logical structure.
